user and developer documentation and respond to pull requests.

== PROJECT: Task Book

---

== Overview

`*_Task Book_*` is a desktop to-do list application. It is a GUI app but most of its user interactions happen in the Command Line Interface (CLI).
It is targeted at *helping busy students manage their daily tasks*
by keeping track of their to-do things, approaching deadlines and categorise them in an orderly manner.
Furthermore, `*_Task Book_*` allows you to set milestones for big projects so that you can finish them manageably on time.
If you can type fast, `*_Task Book_*` can manage your tasks faster than traditional paper notebooks or a mobile application.

== Summary of contributions
Here is an overview of what I have done to support my team in achieving the final goal of our project.

* *Code contributions*: https://nuscs2113-ay1819s1.github.io/dashboard/#=undefined&search=chelseyong[tracked by Reposense]
* *Main feature implemented*: Allows students *to add tasks into the* `*_Task Book_*`
** What it does: Adds a new task with its title, description, priority level and expected hours of completion
** Justification: This is a core feature that serves the main purpose of `*_Task Book_*` and lays the foundation for other features to be built upon
** Highlights: Written model stubs and applied equivalence partitioning for unit-testing the feature to ensure sufficient coverage for the feature

* *Other minor enhancements*:

** Feature that allows students to *complete existing tasks* in the `*_Task Book_*`
*** What it does: Strikes off an incomplete task
*** Justification: Another crucial feature that allows students to focus on incomplete tasks and also track productivity

** Feature that allows students to *track their productivity*
*** What it does: Calculates the average productivity for all the completed tasks
*** Justification: Helps students be more aware of their productivity rate

** Modified code to follow software engineering principles such as Open-Closed Principle (OCP) over

** Project management:
*** Set up the organization repository and its issue tracker
*** Closes milestones and tags repository biweekly
*** Managed releases `v1.1` - `v1.4` (4 https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S1-W13-3/main/releases[releases]) on GitHub
*** Added https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S1-W13-3/main/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+author%3Achelseyong+[issue labels and assigned milestones] to the team's pull requests

to describe user stories of the product as well as to break down user stories into smaller tasks e.g. https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S1-W13-3/main/issues/39[#39], https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S1-W13-3/main/issues/40[#40]
** Documentation:
*** Wrote the use cases and user stories for other feature enhancements, as well
*** Drawn architecture and sequence diagrams to further substantiate how the feature is developed
** Community:
*** Reviewed my teammatesâ€™ pull requests like https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S1-W13-3/main/pull/46[#46], https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S1-W13-3/main/pull/48[#48] and ensure that Travis build is successful before merging the pull requests
